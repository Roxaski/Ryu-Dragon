## Extensions

There are two fonts that i think go wonderfully with Ryu Dragon and they are [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) and [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). In my opinion these two fonts are fantastic for coding, as they're easy on the eyes and they really elevate the look of the theme.
