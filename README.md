## Theme

This theme was created for use in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) i put alot of thought into the color scheme, making sure that all the colors compliment each other and that they all mesh well together. The theme was tested with HTML, CSS & JavaScript in mind. If anyone wants to create an PR's to make any additions or changes, your more than welcome.

## Installation

In order to install this theme, open VS Code and head on over to the extensions tab, alternatively you can use keyboard shortcuts | Windows ( CTRL + Shift + X ) and for Mac ( ⇧ + ⌘ + X ) once there, just type in the theme name into the search bar and click on install, that's it. Enjoi your awesome new theme!

## Font

They're are two fonts that i think go wonderfully with Ryu Dragon and they are [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) and [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). In my opinion these two fonts are fantastic for coding, as they're easy on the eyes and they really elevate the look of the theme.

## Icon

Massive thankyou to [andsproject](https://pixabay.com/vectors/dragon-katana-woman-fantasy-sword-7063556/) for their incredible artwork.
