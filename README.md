## Theme

This theme was created for use in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with alot of thought put into the colors and how they compliment each other.

## Fonts

Now when it comes to fonts they're are two that i think compliment this theme quite well and they are [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) and [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

// LEAVE A NOTE HERE (POSSIBLY WITH PICS) ON HOW TO INSTALL THEM / USE THEM IN VSCODE
