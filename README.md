## Theme

This theme was created for use in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) i put alot of thought into the color scheme, making sure that all the colors compliment each other and that they all mesh well together. The theme was tested with HTML, CSS & JavaScript in mind. If anyone wants to create an PR's to make any additions or changes, your more than welcome.

## Fonts

Now when it comes to fonts they're are two that i think compliment this theme quite well and they are [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) and [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

// LEAVE A NOTE HERE (POSSIBLY WITH PICS) ON HOW TO INSTALL THEM / USE THEM IN VSCODE
